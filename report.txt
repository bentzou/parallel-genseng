OUTLINE

Introduction
Rationale
	While GENSENG outperforms competing algorithms such as CNVnator in accuracy, the current, sequential implementation requires hours to complete an analysis of the human genome. For single samples, the large time requirement may be acceptable since a sample generally needs to be run only once. For many samples, however, the time required is prohibitive and deters large scale implementation. This project explores the use of parallelization to decrease the run-time of GENSENG.
