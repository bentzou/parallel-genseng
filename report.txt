OUTLINE

Introduction
Rationale
	While the accuracy of GENSENG outperforms competing algorithms, such as CNVnator, the sequential implementation of GENSENG requires hours to complete an analysis of the human genome. For single samples, the large time requirement may be acceptable since a sample generally needs to be run only once. For many samples, however, the time required is prohibitive and deters large scale implementation.

	The sequential implementation of GENSENG requires nearly hours to complete when analyzing the entire genome.
